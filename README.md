# TerraModulus

TerraModulus is a fork of [Minicraft+](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived)
(at [`58460dd`](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived/commit/58460ddf4860423a915289d96152150cc09238f6)),
but eventually will be detached from the original codebase.

## Development Progress

### Early Stage

Save directory will be kept under `/playminicraft/mods`, but named as `TerraModulus` instead of `Minicraft_Plus`.
Mainly it is the migration of my pull requests from Minicraft+ to here.
Version will be locked at `0.1.0` and no public release would be done.

### Engine Rewrite Stage
