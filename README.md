# TerraModulus

TerraModulus is a fork of [Minicraft+](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived)
(at [`58460dd`](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived/commit/58460ddf4860423a915289d96152150cc09238f6)),
but eventually will be detached from the original codebase.

## Status

Migration is still in progress:
- including all issues, labels;
- project management; and,
- development roadmap

Currently, in *Early Stage* and *Engine Rewrite Stage*, yet no outside/open contributions (pull requests) would be accepted,
but anyone is still welcome for opinions, suggestions and discussions. Also, before the completion of the stages,
no other feature requests and bug reports would be accepted, unless there is any extra feature suggestion accepted.

Most plans at the moment are still not publicly visible, but would be revealed upon the progress; most issues migrated
are related to the mentioned 2 stages.

Yet, no plan to release snapshots during development in the 2 stages.

## Project Direction

This project aims to be a enhanced version over the original Minicraft, built with much more flexible and customizable features,
along with some more functionalities. Although this started based on Minicraft+ Revived, but will be moved away from it, so
some content added by Minicraft+ would be removed and the entire project will be reworked and rewritten thoroughly.

This will support a lot of flexible APIs, plugins/modding utilities, built-in mod loader, advanced resource packs/data packs,
more than Minicraft+. So, this may be said to be *the successor of MiniMods*. In addition, all the resources would be overhauled,
so to build up modernization and move away from copyright concerns.

Eventually, this project will become a sole project besides Minicraft+, but might be still related to the Minicraft community.

## History

Originally, I have been participating the development in the Minicraft+ Revived project for more than 2 years. Along the time,
I have made a significant amount of changes and code contributions to the project. Afterwards, the amount of contributions seemed to
have taken the place of maintainer's responsibilities, and thus some discussions and arguments occurred in the time being.

At the end of 2024, due to my personal updates to the project management made when the inactivity of the maintainer(s), a conflict appeared
(said to be "*dictating the project*"). By the conflicts, I finally decided to split and migrate my (then and future) works from them to
a new project for further development because of the incompatibilities of philosophies, this project has then been created.

## Development Progress

Main development would only be conducted by me in these stages.

### Early Stage

Save directory will be kept under `/playminicraft/mods`, but named as `TerraModulus` instead of `Minicraft_Plus`.
Mainly it is the migration of my pull requests from Minicraft+ to here.
Version will be locked at `0.1.0` and no public release would be done.

### Engine Rewrite Stage
