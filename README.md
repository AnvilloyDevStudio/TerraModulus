# TerraModulus Relictus

This branch is a fork of [Minicraft+](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived)
(at [`58460dd`](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived/commit/58460ddf4860423a915289d96152150cc09238f6)),
with several changes conducted.

## Information

Active development is in the [main branch](https://github.com/AnvilloyDevStudio/TerraModulus/tree/main). Early Stage has been ended at
[`b2a8b103`](https://github.com/AnvilloyDevStudio/TerraModulus/commit/b2a8b103afe7c9122d8b40b1d2f20dc7fcc98d5c)
in this branch. Only very early development changes would be made here, and referred to the main branch.
No any open contribution related to this is allowed, but you may fork and/or build this source code yourself.

### Early Stage

Save directory will be kept under `/playminicraft/mods`, but named as `TerraModulus` instead of `Minicraft_Plus`.
Mainly it is the migration of my pull requests from Minicraft+ to here.
Version will be locked at `0.1.0` and no public release would be done.

Therefore, if you would like to access the builds, you have to build them yourself.
